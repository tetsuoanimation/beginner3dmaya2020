Welcome to 3D Design Basics - WS2020
====================================

Welcome to the 3D Design Basics course at HS-Augsburg!
You can find all lessons and topics in the navigation column to the left. We try
to give you an abbreviated overview on how Autodesk Maya works and we want to
create our first 3D scenes together.

While we try to cover most functions of Maya we need, we won't be able to do
it's massive toolset justice. If you want to learn more, always check out the
`Official Autodesk Maya Manual <https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/>`_
