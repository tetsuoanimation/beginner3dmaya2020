**********
Assignment
**********
The goal of this exercise is to create a futuristic or cyberpunky city block made of 
primitive objects only. You will also have to assign basic materials and light the
scene.

************
Deliverables
************

* Render 1080 x 1080 PNG-File ( Arnold or Render-Engine of your choice )
* .ma-file

.. warning::
    | Make sure to name all files using the following naming convention:
    | *lesson1_firstname_lastname.ext ( where .ext is the file extension )*

***************
Links and Tipps
***************

* Make sure to set up a correct Maya Workspace, see :ref:`workspaceSetup`.
* You can find out all about the tools needed to create the geometry for 
  this assignment in the :ref:`workingWithPrimitives` section.
* Think about the scene first. Create the big forms first and add detail later.
* The :ref:`bigMediumSmall` and :ref:`80_20rule` design rules will help you a 
  lot when composing the scene.
* You can always use reference or other ways of growing your :ref:`visualLibrary`,
  just don't lift ideas directly from this assignment's example scene. 

*******************
Assigning Materials
*******************
To use different colors on your objects, you will need to assign materials and shaders
to your scene. This section will explain in a really basic way how to set up and 
assign the materials for this assignment. It is by no means exhaustive and we won't be
covering how to create a realistic looking material or what each of the settings and
parameters of a material do.

Lighting the assignment
***********************
This will be a very short look into lighting with Maya lights and Arnold. This section
is by no means exhaustive, lighting technique and principles are complex and will be 
covered in depth later in this course. 
This section will be an overview and give you the tools to creatively and beautifully 
light this assignment.

*********
Rendering
*********
We will be using Maya's integrated render engine 'Arnold' to render the final images.
As with lighting, this section is by no means exhaustive but will give you a quick step
by step way to set up the render correctly. 
Final rendering can take quite some time, so plan at least 10 minutes for the final
image render.

.. hint:: 
    If you do not want to use Arnold, you are invited to use any render engine of
    your choice. Please note that this is your own resposibility and I won't be able
    to support all render engines.
