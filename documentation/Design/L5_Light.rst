Lighting
########

Light is not just adding brightness and shadows to your render. It has to be used to support your composition, design and storytelling in your image or film.
When lighting, you are designing with color, shape and form - this means it is crucial to keep the gestalt principles as well as your composition in mind. 
Lighting is getting a lot more complex when you light for a moving image, but it also offers a bunch of 'cheats'.

This section aims to provide a short overview of the ideas you should keep in mind when lighting your shots.

*******************
Lighting Principles
*******************

Using light as a design and as a compositional element means that there are some overall ideas we should keep in mind when adding lights to our scene. You will find that many of these cross over with the `Gestalt Principles <Design/L4_GestaltPrinciples>`__ as well as color theory.

If you are not able to change the color, size or shape of objects in your frame, composition and lighting are the key to a satisfying image.

I will be using the principles by Chris Brehon in his `Cinematic Lighting Blog <https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/chapter-6-lighting-principles/>`__ which helped me a lot for my own lighting knowledge by giving names to the 'things' we look for when lighting.
To find out more about these principles as well as a bunch of amazing examples, I can only recommend to read `his blog/book <https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/>`_
