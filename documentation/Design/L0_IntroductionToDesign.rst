Things to keep in mind
**********************

* Make a habit of drawing / sketching.
* Observe, watch and do stuff.
* Practice on smaller scenes / ideas.
* Try to finish what you started.
* Do studies ( and get used to delete them ).
* This is a long journey, there are no shortcuts.
* Push further! - Our mind tells us we are done when we are only 40% there.
* No work is ever lost, even if you just have learned form a mistake.
