Overview of the 3D Pipeline
###########################

This lesson will give you a quick overview of all the departments, steps and milestones in a 3D Production. Most of the
time, these tasks will be split between multiple artists with special and deeper knowledge of their specific field.
Making 3D content relies heavily on communication between departments. Even if you have no interest in some of these
fields, learning them will make your and other artists life much easier, production smoother and ultimately result in a
better film, game or commercial. Furthermore, knowing at least some of the skills involved in each stage will enable you
to create your own animated content.
