Gestalt Principles
##################

The Gestalt Principles have their source in Gestalt Psychology, a school of thought in psychology that describes human
perception as the innate skill of making sense and giving order to chaos. This proposal was experimentaly tested and
proven by a group of german and austrian psychologists in the beginning of the 20th century.

Different groups of psychologists tested and proved those theories and came up with the rules listed down below. Later,
the name 'Gestalt-Psychology' changed to 'Gestalt-Theory', implying that these laws can be used in a wide range of media
and that they are not limited to psychology only.

By now, we know that each of these rules are a major factor in how an image or shape is percieved.

Instead of writing long and detailed explanations, I tried to keep this section down to an example as well as a one
liner that is easy to remember. If you want to learn more about these 'rules', check out the links posted above. You can
also visit your local library for a bunch of information on these laws.

Figure Ground Relationship
==========================

To clearly recognize any shape, we need to be able to differenciate it from its background. A good
figure-ground-relationship makes sure your focal points are easily read by a viewer

Similarity
==========

Similar looking objects will be percieved as belonging together. In contrast, objects that stand out among a crowd will
be percieved as 'wrong' or 'intruding'.

Proximity
=========

Elements that are positioned close to each other are likely percieved as belonging together. This effect is enhanced
when the elements look similar as well.

Law of continuity
=================

Human perception is more likely to percieve a flowing line as belonging together than it would sharp angles. Crossing
shapes will most likely be seen as crossing lines and not sharp angles. Also, we tend to complete a broken line in our minds.

Closure
=======

Incomplete but recognizable shapes are more likely to be completed by our perception than seeing each of the parts as
their own.

Law of simplicity
=================

Shapes are percieved in their simplest or in their most known forms

Symmetry
========

Even if we can't find symmetry in an image, our perception wants to form and find a center point around which a
compostition feels symmetrical.
