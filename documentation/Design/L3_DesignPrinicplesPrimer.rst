Contrast
********

Contrast defines the differenct between two states. While it can be anything, contrast in temperature,
contrast in volume or emotional contrast, we care most about value contrast, colour contrast and contrast
in shape when designing. Psycologically, contrast helps us to define, sort and understand our surroundings.
When creating anything, we can use this knowledge to shape the perception, story and emotion percieved by
an audience.

    Source: Sinix Design Design Theory

Big - Medium - Small, Primary - Secondary - Tertiary, First Read - Second Read - Third Read are
all different names for the same design principle: Make your composition easy to read and understand
by splitting it into shapes of different sizes.

A viewer will recognize the big shapes first, followed by the smaller and only in the end look at 
the details. You can use this to create a 'flow', hierarchy and even story in you images. Further,
this principle will make your image interesting, appealing and nice to look at.

Make sure your composition has at least all three types of shapes in it. The size of each of these
types should be clearly different then the next smaller or bigger shape. All other design principles
will work in tandem with big

.. _80_20rule:

70 - 30 Rule:
=============

This rule is related to the big - medium - small rule. You can also find it called the 80-20 rule. According
to this rule dividing a space or form into subshapes of 70 and 30% of the primary form's area results in a
more appealing image than other ratios. It is also used for the distribution of detail: Leaving 70 percent of the 
area with low detail and filling the 30 with smaller details.

.. hint::
    The numbers in this rule aren't incredibly important. The only thing to remember when creating objects,
    shapes and pictures is that our perception likes contrast. - Following this notion, making sure to divide,
    compose and add details in a manner that creates areas of contrast will always result in a more appealing
    result than aimlessly cluttering the shape, form or composition.

Shape Grouping

The Rule Of Thirds
==================

The golden ratio divides a space by roughly 1.64.

The rule of thirds divides an image into 3 spaces vertically and 3 spaces horizontally. It then places
the major lines and focus points on these intersections.

.. warning::
    While the rule of thirds is a nice tool to create an interesting composition quickly, you won't get
    very far using only this tool. Used only by itself, the rule of thirds produces bland and uninteresting
    compositions.

Dynamic Symmetry and Major Area Division:
=========================================

Simple erkl√§rung: Bilddiagonale und darauf senkrecht stehende diagonalen die in den Ecken beginnen bilden an 
ihren Schnittpunkten 'Eyes' bzw areas of focus.
Lines dividing the image through the eyes are used as verticals.

Baroque Diagonal - Bot Left To Up Right: More 'pleasing', is known to people from perspective lines and reading
left to right

Sinister Diagonal - Up Left To Bot Right

Use Parallel Angles! ( Dynamic Symmetry encourages using the gamut of angles it provides )
Check Figure Ground Relationship
